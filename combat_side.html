        <article class="grid-text-placement2">The combat in Persona is a unique mix between the normal RPG combat and an interesting take on familiar/pet based combat(for example pokemon). Elemental weaknesses are very important, and everyone has different resistances to be aware of. some enemies might even reflect all but one element.</article>
        <article id="Ctext3">When you hit an enemy with something they are weak to they get knocked down until their next turn, while giving you another turn to attack. When an enemy is knocked down attacks against them can potentially make them skip a turn. If every enemy is knocked down, you can potentially perform a powerful "All-Out Attack" against all enemies.</article>
